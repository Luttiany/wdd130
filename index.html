            <p>Hello! I'm Luttiany Dias and I'm from Fortaleza - CE, Brazil! I"m a father of two boys, Lorenzo and Murilo, I also enjoy riding motorcycles
                and I work with security systems. Right now, I work at Intelbras, a technology company. I have served on a mission in Brasil S√£o Paulo Interlagos
                mission between 2001 and 2003. I'm married with Keila for about 11 years. I'm serving on my ward right now as the 1st counselor in elders quorum. 
                I was baptized at the Church in 1996, almost 30 years. I have a strong testimony that this church is true and that Jesus is my savior and redeemer,
                That the book of Mormon is the word of God and that we have inspired and true profets in these last days. I'm so happy to live in this time, where
                the church is restored and the priesthood is again with us. I feel blessed and grateful for all the resources, including BYU and this course. I feel 
                it's a great oportunity to grow in knowledge. I also hope that my example will help my kids to see the importance of education and the seeking of good
                skills to get better oportunities in life.
            </p>
